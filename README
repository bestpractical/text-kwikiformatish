NAME
    Text::KwikiFormatish - convert Kwikitext into XML-compliant HTML

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::KwikiFormatish;
      my $xml = Text::KwikiFormatish::format($text);

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Kwiki includes a formatter (CGI::Kwiki::Formatter) for converting
    Kwikitext (a nice form of wikitext) to HTML. Unfortunately, it isn't
    easy to use the formatter outside the CGI::Kwiki environment.
    Additionally, the HTML produced by the formatter isn't XHTML-1
    compliant. This module aims to fix both of these issues and provide an
    interface similar to Text::WikiFormat.

    Essentially, this module is the code from Brian Ingerson's
    CGI::Kwiki::Formatter with a "format" subroutine, code relating to
    slides removed, tweaked subroutinesa, and more.

    Since the wikitext spec for input wikitext for this module differs a
    little from the default Kwiki formatter, I thought it best to call it
    "Formatish" instead of *the* Kwiki Format.

  format()
    "format()" takes one or two arguments, with the first always being the
    wikitext to translate. The second is a hash of options, but currently
    the only option supported is "prefix" in case you want to prefix wiki
    links with sommething. For example,

      my $xml = Text::KwikiFormatish::format(
        $text,
        prefix => '/wiki/',
        );

  Differences from the Kwiki Formatter
    * The output of the formatter is XML-compliant.
    * Extra equal signs at the end of headings will be removed from the
    output for compatibility with other wikitext formats.
    * Italicized text is marked up by two slashes instead of one. This is to
    prevent weirdness when writing filesystem paths in Kwikitext -- e.g.,
    the text "Check /etc or /var or /usr/" will have unexpected results when
    formatted in a regular Kwiki.
    * Horizontal rules, marked by four or more hyphens, may be followed by
    spaces.
    * Processing order of text segments has been changed (tables are
    processed last)
    * Bold text is marked up as "<strong>" instead of "<b>"
    * "Inline" is marked up as "<code>" instead of "<tt>"
    * mdashes (really long hyphens) are created with wikitext "like---this"
    * Tables and code sections are not indented with "<blockquote>" tags
    * Comments do not have to have a space immediately following the hash
    * Patch to named_link code
    * All code pertaining to slides or Kwiki access control is removed, as
    neither are within the scope of this module

  Plugins
        I've included two plugins, "img" and "icon", to do basic image
        support besides the standard operation of including an image when
        the URL ends with a common image extension.

EXAMPLES
    Here's some kwiki text:

        = Level 1 Header
    
        == Level 2 with optional trailing equals ==
    
        Kwikitext provides a bit more flexibility than regular wikitext.
    
        All HTML code is <escaped>. Horizontal rules are four or more hyphens:
    
        ----
    
        While you can add an mdash---like this.
    
        ##
        ## you can add comments in the kwikitext which appear as XML comments
        ##
    
        == Links
    
        === Itemized Lists
    
        * Fruit
        ** Oranges
        ** Apples
        * Eggs
        * Salad
    
        === Enumerated Lists
    
        ##
        ## below are zero's, not "oh's"
        ##
    
        0 One
        0 Two
        0 Three
    
        * Comments in the wikitext
        * Easier:
        ** Bold/strong
        ** Italic/emphasized
    
        == More Markup
    
        *strong or bold text*
    
        //emphasized or italic text//
    
          indented text is verbatim (good for code)
    
        == Links
    
        WikiLink
    
        !NotAWikiLink
    
        http://www.kwiki.org/
    
        [Kwiki named link http://www.kwiki.org/]
    
        == Images
    
        http://search.cpan.org/s/img/cpan_banner.png
    
        == KwikiFormatish plugins
    
        This inserts an image with the CSS class of "icon" -- good for inserting a right-aligned image for text to wrap around.

        The following inserts an image with an optional caption:
